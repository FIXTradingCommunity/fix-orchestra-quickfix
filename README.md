# fix-orchestra-quickfix

![](FIXorchestraLogo.png)

This project contains integrations between FIX Orchestra and QuickFIX.

* FIX Orchestra is intended to provide a standard and some reference implementation for *machine readable rules of engagement* between counterparties. 

* QuickFIX is a popular, open-source FIX engine. It has been implemented or ported to several programming languages, including C++, Java, .NET, and golang.

## Modules

Some models in this project are intended to be operational while others are proofs of concept.

### repository-quickfix

This module generates a QuickFIX data dictionary from an Orchestra file. The format can be consumed by the C++, Java and .NET versions. Additionally, the module generates message classes for QuickFIX/J directly from an Orchestra file. Although the QuickFIX data dictionary format is not as richly featured as Orchestra, it is hoped that this utility will help with Orchestra adoption. 

### model-quickfix
This module generates code that is conformant to the QuickFIX/J API for validating and populating messages. It is dependent on `repository-quickfix`.

### session-quickfix
A demonstration of session configuration for QuickFIX open-source FIX engine. It consumes an XML file in the `interfaces` schema.
